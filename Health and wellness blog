            <img src="https://via.placeholder.com/600x300?text=Balanced+Diet" alt="Balanced Diet">
            <p>A balanced diet is crucial for maintaining overall health. It provides the necessary nutrients your body needs to function correctly. Incorporate a variety of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean proteins into your daily meals.</p>
            <p>Consider adding more omega-3 fatty acids into your diet. These can be found in fish, flaxseeds, and walnuts. Also, drink plenty of water throughout the day to stay hydrated.</p>
            <p>Remember to limit processed foods, sugary drinks, and excessive salt intake.</p>
